Natural intelligence
think,learn,explore

buy groceries..
labelled data - grain - name

name flowers,vegetables
thick book
A- Apple
B - Ball
C  - Cat

Machine learning
supervised - 
data is labelled data

set of fruits which are labelled
images to the machine

input and output
data -  label


data is not labelled in unsupervised
machine learning

village - different kind of fruits
shape,size,smell 
jack fruits - group

re-inforcement 
playing a chess game
driver less car

what is the price of petrol in 
next week
regression or classification
supervised - 110,99,89,108
unsupervised

is it going to rain on sunday
Yes/No/maybe - classification

working in a bank as a data engineer
set of financial transactions
find any fraudulent transaction
Yes/No
Supervised machine learning -
date,amout, labelled
anomaly detection

driverless car - what kind of machine learning - re-inforcement.. machine learning

google colab..
azure ml

1. Simple linear regression using google colab
homeprices.csv
area - independent
price - dependent

feed this data to model
area to the model 
predict the price
regression
linear regression
as area increases
price is also increasing
y=mx+c
m - slope
c - intercept
x - independent
y - dependent

Steps:
1. search for google colab in chrome
2. Sign up with gmail
3. click on new notebook
4. Rename the notebook as linearregressiondemo.ipynb
5. To upload data
click on files icon
and upload the file
